# OpportunistiKapacity
A python library to turn mobility traces into opportunistic contact capacity. 
This library aims to simplify the calculation of total network data capacity, more precisely in the context of contact networks. 
## Basic run
You must provide at least **3** parameters for the software to run:

 1. The mobility dataset
 2. A propagation model
 3. A modulation scheme

If these arguments are known, you can run the script:
`./wrapper.py file_dataset propagation_model modulation_scheme`
